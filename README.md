University Project

On this project, you will find information for the course CIND 820.

The title of the proeject is 'Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of International Coffee Prices with a Variety of Algorithms of Machine Learning'

Folders have the following description:

Abstract: has the version in PDF and Word document of the abstract presented for Module 1

CIND 820 Modules: Are the modules for the course CIND 820, printed on PDF

Assignments: Are the folder where I put the files that are send as asignments

Literature Review Papers: contains some of the papers, not all that are quoted on the References

Precios-área-y-producción-de-café.xlsx: Is the file in Excel where the data comes from, however the data can be downloaded directly from this link https://federaciondecafeteros.org/app/uploads/2020/01/Precios-%C3%A1rea-y-producci%C3%B3n-de-caf%C3%A9.xlsx

Coffee Price Regression Analysis.ipynb : Is the Official Jupiter Notebook for the project, this file has the following content:

1 Start

  1.1 Dataset
  
  1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis 
  
2 Start of Machine Learning Regression Algorithms

  2.1 Split the data frame intro Train (X) and Test (y)
  
  2.2 Get the OLS (Ordinary Least squares) and Obtain the Model 
  
3 Model: 

  3.1 Regressions Not Normalized
  
    3.1.1 Methodology 
    
  3.2 Create X train, X test, Y train and Y test
  
    3.2.1 Linear Regression 
    
    3.2.2 Decision Tree Regressor 
    
    3.2.3 LASSO Regressor (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)
    
    3.2.4 SVM Support Vector Machine Regressor 
    
  3-3 Regressions Normalized
  
    3.3.1 Methodology 
    
  3-4 Split the data frame intro Train (X) and Test (y) 
  
  3-5 Normalize with StandarsScaler 
  
  3.6 Create X train, X test, Y train and Y test
  
    3.6.1 Linear Regression Normalized 
    
    3.6.2 Decision Tree Regressor Normalized 
    
    3.6.3 LASSO Regressor (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) 
    
    3.6.4 SVM Support Vector Machine Regressor Normalized 
    
    3.6.5 Neural Network

Testing Codes.ipynb: Is a Jupiter notebook just for testing purposes, code updates and ideas

Checking for Normality.ipynb: is a Jupiter notebook, independant that checks for Normality with the model created for regression, will be added to the project but runs parallel to Coffee Price Regression Analysis.ipynb

neural_network.npz : is a numpy file created in order to work with the neural network
