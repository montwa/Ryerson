University Project

On this project, you will find information for the course CIND 820.

The title of the proeject is 'Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of International Coffee Prices with a Variety of Algorithms of Machine Learning'

Folders have the following description:

Abstract: has the version in PDF and Word document of the abstract presented for Module 1

CIND 820 Modules: Are the modules for the course CIND 820, printed on PDF

Assignments: Are the folder where I put the files that are send as asignments

Literature Review Papers: contains some of the papers, not all that are quoted on the References

Precios-área-y-producción-de-café.xlsx: Is the file in Excel where the data comes from, however the data can be downloaded directly from this link https://federaciondecafeteros.org/app/uploads/2020/01/Precios-%C3%A1rea-y-producci%C3%B3n-de-caf%C3%A9.xlsx

Testing Codes.ipynb: Is a Jupiter notebook just for testing purposes, code updates and ideas

Checking_for_Normality.ipynb: is a Jupiter notebook, independant that checks for Normality with the model created for regression, will be added to the project but runs parallel to Coffee Price Regression Analysis.ipynb

neural_network.npz : is a numpy file created in order to work with the neural network
